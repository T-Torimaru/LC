/**
 \page createBadChannelsList_exe The createBadChannelsList executable
 
\section ListGeneration Creating a list of bad channels from a number of runs

Run the \c createBadChannelsList command with a list of run numbers (or a
single run number) as arguments. The programme has to be run in the same directory as
the input files, which have to be named RUNNUMBER.root. 

There is an option \c --with5RMSCut to turn on the 5*RMS cut for the channel
spectra (see \ref FiveRMSCut "The 5*RMS cut section" of SpectrumPropertiesRunInfo
class). This option has to be the first argument, the list of run numbers follows.

\note Currently also an ahc.cfg  file is needed, the name AHCforCERN2010.cfg
is hard coded. This will change once the modified version of ahcBinHst is
fully working and the mapping is already included in the histgram names.

The executable produces the list of bad channels. The file is named \c
badChannels.txt. The channel status is according to \todo make channel status
the one in userlib::CellQuality.

In addition you get a plot of the number of dead, noisy and bad (=dead +
noisy) channels versus the run number, to monitor the history and see if all
runs are ok or individual runs have to be excluded. You get a pdf and a C
makro. The makro is useful to zoom into certain regions and identify 
\todo Fix the hardcoded offset of 360000 in the run number for the x-axis on
the history plot.

From the history plot you can easily identify if there exceptionally few or
many dead or noisy channels. Having a closer look at a run is done using the 
\ref rootLib "root library".
