/**
\mainpage Dead and Noisy Channels Analysis for CALICE Test Beam

\section Introduction

Determining dead and noisy channels is based on the analysis of the channel
ADC spectra recorded during a PMNoiseRun. These spectra are provided by \c
ahcBinHst from the \c calice_daq package.

Only the mean of the distribution (the pedestal in case of a noise run) and
the width (RMS) are used.

\section Definition Definition of dead and noisy
Currently dead and noisy are only defined from the RMS.
\subsection Noisy
Looking at RMS sectrum
of all channels one sees that most channels have an RMS around 40, but some
channels (the noisy ones) have much larger RMS, causing a tail in the
distribution.

<b>Definiton of noisy: RMS > 140 </b>

\subsection Dead 
A comparisan with data and LEDVCalib runs has shown that the peak at the lover
end of the distribution contains basically only dead channels (see section
"Comparing two runs").

<b>Definiton of dead: RMS < 20.5 </b>

\section SWOverview Software overview
The software basically consists of two parts
\li The root library \c libDeadAndNoisyTools which conveniently allows to
access the RMS and pedestal values of one or several runs
\li The \c createBadChannelsList executable which creates the list of bad
channels to be written to the database.

\section Outlook Outlook
\todo Implement convenience draw functions which create the default plots with
well formated axis labels etc.
\todo Transfer missing functionality from C scripts.
\todo Maybe implement GUI?
