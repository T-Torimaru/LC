\section Download
DeadAndNoisyTools is part of the calice_calib package. To download the
latest version from svn directly check it out of the repsoitory:
\code
$~> svn co https://svnsrv.desy.de/public/calice/calice_calib/trunk calice_calib
\endcode


\section Installation
The calice software uses CMake to generate the Makefiles. It is recommended to do an out of souce
build. To do so create a build directory and run CMake.

\section Dependencies
\li Root
\li CMakeModules from ILCSoft
\li calice_cmake
\li calice_userlib [planned]

The DeadAndNoisyTools depend on Root. In order to find it the CMakeModules
from ILCSoft are used. To generate the documetation a CMake makro from 
calice_cmake is used.

\warning
Linking to the calice_userlib 
ensures that the status produced by createBadChannelsList really is the status of
the lccd \c CellQuality class which is in the data base. This is not implemented yet.
The current status is the expert status, which currently is identical to the data base status,
but this done manually is not guaranteed if either createBadChannelsList or \c CellQuality
change. Check consistency before writing to the data base!

\section installExample Example
This example assumes that ILCSoft is installed in a directory pointed to by
${ILCPATH} and that the calice_cmake directory is known to the ILCSoft.cmake.
Do not forget the two dots at the end of the cmake command.
\code
$~/calice_calib> mkdir build; cd build
$~/calice_calib/build> cmake -C ${ILCPATH}/ILCSoft.cmake ..
$~/calice_calib/build> make
\endcode
