Most of the shell scripts here need a workdir with the following directory structure inside the workdir:

data
data/run
data/log
data/run
data/slw
data/sum
data/temp

MakeRootFiles_NN.sh:
A script to run ahcBinHst on a list of runs. The bin files must be in data/run.
For PMNoise runs just give the list of run numbers. For beam data runs add the
 -o0 option. This only processes the configs %0, which are the PmNoise configs
in the beam data files.
You can also use -o1, which gives the LED configs.
