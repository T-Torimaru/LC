Here the calicesim lib is created which is used
to transform the pure simulation into reco conform
data types. 
The library has to be included in corresponding (reco) jobs

The package supports cmake building. For this a calicebuild.cmake
has to be present (available in userlib). Adjust the pathes in there
accordingly.

mkdir buildsim
cd buildim
cmake -C <your_path>/calicebuild.cmake <your_path>/calice_sim
make install

Building and setting environment variables (old style): 
Adjust the 'env.sh' script according to your needs and then ...

. ./env.sh --compile
(setting only environment: see . ./env.sh --help)
gmake
