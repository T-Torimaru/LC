* Java analysis code

digisim/java/RawHistos.java - Java analysis code
digisim/java/build          - build script
digisim/java/files.lis	   - List of files needed to build (local directory)

* Usage instructions (under bash or similar):

  Edit LCIO and JAS3 variables in file build, to reflect the local
  configuration of your machine.  Then use the following commands:

  % . build    # also sets up CLASSPATH, so it should be run at least once
               # in the session
  % java RawHistos inputFile1.slcio inputFile2.slcio inputFile3.slcio

  An AIDA histogram file called histos.aida will be produced in local
  directory.  JAS3 can be used to look at the histograms.
