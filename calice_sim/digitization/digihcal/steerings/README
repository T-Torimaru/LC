_Incomplete_ README for AHCAL digitization

Please read http://www-flc.desy.de/flc/flcwiki/HCAL_Digitization for
an overview.

The steerings are currently for HCAL only runs CERN 2007. The input
and output file names have to be put in.

For other runs types some folders need to be changed, see
http://www-flc.desy.de/flc/flcwiki/NonHcalConditionsData .

The order is: ganging, digitization, reconstruction. In addition noise
can be generated and overlayed in the digitization step.
