--- Improved scheme for new objects ---

There is now an abstract base class writeLCGenericObject
which can parse command line options, open the database for 
writing and so on.

By inheritance one has to implement the format of the flat file
used to create the new objects going to database.

Easy examples are writeSimpleValues, writeLinearFitConstants, 
writeLinearFitSlopes.

If you want to add a new data type use the examples as a skeleton.
Most probably you just have to change the parsing of the flat file
and the name of your object.
