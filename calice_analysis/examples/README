example001 - Example steering files (reconstruction with two different sets of muon
             calibration factors and analysis) and ROOT macro used for the analysis
             presented in CAN-034 and PhD thesis "Low-energetic Hadron Interactions
             in a Highly Granular Calorimeter" by N. Feege (in preparation).
             The analysis is based on data collected with the AHCAL and the TCMT
             (without any ECAL) at Fermilab in July 2008 and May 2009.
             The example run 520308 is a 10 GeV negative pion run.

example002 -Example steering files (For PandoraPFA tests using overlaid
            charged pion test beam data) used for the analysis
 	    presented in CAN-024 by Oleg Markin.
            CALICE 2007 test beam data were used.

get_HCalPIDtree.py

- python script to create a ROOT tree with booleans for particle ID selection 
  (electron, pion, muon, etc), using as input the ROOT tree created by the 
  RootTreeWriter
- valid for CERN 2010 runs
- you can then AddFriend the output tree to your input tree, and do the 
  selection, eg:

  bigtree->AddFriend(pID);
  bigtree->Draw("ahc_energySum", "beamBit && muon");

  where:
  bigtree - is the name of the tree in the ROOT file created by the 
            RootTreeWriter, more specifically by the HitWriteEngine
  pID - is the name of the tree in the ROOT file created by the above script.

An example steering file to show the usage of the DEHEventDisplayProcessor
for the new prototype (EBU and HBU) testbeam configuration CERN Oct 2014.

    The new prototype testbeam configuration may be changed,
    The database may be modified following the development process. 
    Please update it to the latest development.
