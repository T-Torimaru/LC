This is the software package to reconstruct calice data.
It runs over lcio files as produced by the converter. See the
announcements in the calice-sw mailing lists for compatibility
issues with converted files

Prerequisites:

It needs marlin (lcio) lccd and CondDBMySQL installed
as well as the calice userlib and root. 
Depending on your marlin installation it might also
need to know the path to the CLHEP libraries.

See also the doxygen documentation of the corresponding version of the
calice_reco package.


To install:

modify the env.sh script

. ./env.sh
gmake -C src
